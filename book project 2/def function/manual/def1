def :- using thsi we can define an character to utilize at later  like Print(), Square() {for squarig the number}

   
def Print():    

    ---snip---      
    return __        
       
Print('x')

: in here i create a parameter  Print() and i can pass any argument for this
: if  i need some kind of information to perform the task add the requirement at Print('_')
: We can use Print method any time to performit work which is  defined already that what to do.
: I can use return to make sure what to return after performing the task .as if I perform 100     
  task to get 1 value i can easily get only 1 value usig the return method

if you want to make any argument optional just asssign it to ''(middle = '') i mean to make it use if the value are left for it.

we can use a parameter infinte time for the differnet argument

1.the python work as:
  def a(b,c):
   

   pass

  a(anuj,sharma)

  so in here it match anuj to b and sharma to c

2. but if we define as
   def a(b,c=sharma):
   pass

   a(anuj)

   in this case we get the output anuj sharma as the python set the value anuj a b and c is already defined as sharma

   so c is called as keyword argument

  3. we can also make any argument optional as if we say c = '' and define only one value
